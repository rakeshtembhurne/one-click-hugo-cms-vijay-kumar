It was during my tenure in banking I came across a very big customer having spinning mill at Washim district. The customer of the bank required  a limit of Rs.2 crore as working capital for running the factory smoothly. however, the bank’s head office has made it an opportunity to building its retail products of insurance scheme to an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- as premium of life covering of the gentlemen to their completion of target fixed by their H O. The gentlemen was very wise  and accepted to the request of their banker and committed to give the premium.

On sanction of the limit by the bank’s head office when he drew the working capital from a branch at Akola, the gentlemen asked the branch manager to deduct Rs.1000000/- for the premium of policy he promised to their  sanctioning authorities.  The matter was dealt by the manager working at Akola branch and asked the customer whether the policy will be continued for the 10 years period with payment of Rs.1000000/- premium every year.  The answer was no, but I will write off the amount in the balance sheets.

The branch manager has not accepted for which several years he was tortured by the Top level officials continuously for business of insurance till he left the branch.

Financial literacy in INDIA is very difficult in reaching the people of various cities and genders, particularly the poor sector and middle class are the persons who tends towards the people for  belief and easily take to a ride explaining without the knowledge of the financial products such as insurance in life, health, and general insurance are sold in the market.  The poor people fall prey to this kind of advices.

Coming to the senior citizens they are very much in need of the easy money and without having thought, they are duped wisely by the miscreant in the society.
I came across the n number of people after investing their good and honestly earned money with people who offer a very high rate of interest and the post dated cheques for few months  in their hand.  |The greed for money by these elders put them in loss and they do not know how  the  circumvent the situation and further to meet their necessity in a way they think it is fit by draining out their savings and also make family debt prown.

My vision is that  "The dream of a developed India is possible only when we have 100% Financial Literacy".
